Playable at [titan.kenhoff.net]

Teardown and postmortem at [my personal site](http://kenhoff.net/games/titan)

Voteable at [the compo page](somewhere on ludum dare)

Titan is an experimental game using Phaser, Firebase, and a lot of window manipulation.

The aesthetic is vaguely Lovecraftian; recommended reading is [In the Walls of Eryx](http://www.spacewesterns.com/articles/104/).
